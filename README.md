# Naive Bayes:

- one of the simplest classification.
- also known as a probabilistic classifier.
- it is often a good choice as an initial baseline classification.
- is a generative model.

Naive Babes Types:
- Gaussian : Gaussian Distribution (continuaus)
- Multinomail : Multinomial Distrbution (counts)
- Bernoulli :Bernoulli Distribution (Binary)


When to use Naive Bases 

- for very well-separated categories, when model complexity is less important.
- for very high-dimensional data, when model complexity is less important.


Pros 

1- Extremely fast for both training and predication.
2- provide straightforward probabilistic prediction.
3- often very easily interpretable.
4- have very few(if any)tunable parameters.


Cons 

1- practically, dependencies exist among features.
2- Zero conditional probability problem (predictor absence)
3- The predictor variables need to be standardised.
