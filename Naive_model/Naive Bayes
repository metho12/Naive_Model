\f0\fs24 \cf0 Naive Bayes:\
\
- one of the simplest classification.\
- also known as a probabilistic classifier.\
- it is often a good choice as an initial baseline classification.\
- is a generative model.\
\
Naive Babes Types:\
- Gaussian : Gaussian Distribution (continuaus)\
- Multinomail : Multinomial Distrbution (counts)\
- Bernoulli :Bernoulli Distribution (Binary)\
\
\
When to use Naive Bases \
\
- for very well-separated categories, when model complexity is less important.\
- for very high-dimensional data, when model complexity is less important.\
\
\
Pros \
\
1- Extremely fast for both training and predication.\
2- provide straightforward probabilistic prediction.\
3- often very easily interpretable.\
4- have very few(if any)tunable parameters.\
\
\
Cons \
\
1- practically, dependencies exist among features.\
2- Zero conditional probability problem (predictor absence)\
3- The predictor variables need to be standardised.\
